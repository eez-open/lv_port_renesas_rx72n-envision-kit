# LVGL ported to Renesas RX72N Envision Kit

## Overview

Equipped with 32-bit microcomputer, RX family flagship RX72N is an excellent choice for GUI creation using LCD, HMI development such as voice input/output, and IoT device development using Wi-Fi, BLE or Ethernet. By using LVGL's demo repository with Renesas' ecosystem, you can experience immediately and develop quickly.

The IC is equipped with the third-generation RX CPU core, the RXv3, and an internal networking of peripheral allowing real-time control high-performance with a single chip. The device also has complete security capability, vital for industrial and consumer equipment today.

## Getting started

### Hardware setup
- Connect the USB cable to the `Debug` (ECN1) connector, next to the Ethernet port.
- Set both channels of SW1 (next to ECN1) to OFF

### Software setup
- You can clone the repository with the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_renesas_rx72n-envision-kit.git --recurse-submodules
    ```
    Downloading the `.zip` from GitHub doesn't work as it doesn't download the submodules.

- Follow the *RX family* section of the [*documentation*](https://docs.lvgl.io/master/integration/chip/renesas.html#get-started-with-the-renesas-ecosystem) to prepare your environment and import the project
